# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋

I’m an **Industrial Engineer turned Product Manager** with 10 years of experience creating, launching, and scaling digital products. I currently lead the Official Products portfolio at LALIGA, shaping the vision and prioritizing initiatives that enhance the fan experience for millions.

I am specialized in full ownership of the product lifecycle, from vision to scale, and my focus is on **measurable outcomes** with an **AI-first and data-driven approach** for making an impact on the business.

## What I work on

**My approach to AI is that it should do augmentation.** Meaning, I use AI to produce the same quality as before, but in less time. I am deeply connected to the AI ecosystem, primarily through X, where I follow the latest AI releases to ensure my toolkit remains state-of-the-art.

Currently, I use Claude Code and Google Antigravity as my primary drivers for technical execution and research. What excites me most is how AI has transformed my role from a traditional PM into a AI Product Manager. Without being a professional developer, I am now able to write, implement, and deploy functional code. 

## Tech Stack & Product Toolkit 🛠️

This is my refined core product toolkit. I constantly try and test new tools (AI, No-Code) to stay updated on emerging technology stacks and trends, ensuring my approach remains sharp and scalable.
