# ALD Skills

**49 skills and 2 workflows that turn Claude Code into a product team.**

This is the public layer of [ald-os](https://github.com/alunadev) — a personal
AI Product Management Operating System I use daily to run the full product
loop with AI agents: `problem → context → PRD → prototype → build → ship → learn`.

Every skill here is battle-tested on real work — PRDs, product strategy,
full-stack side projects, design systems, interview prep, and content. Nothing
in this library is theoretical: if a skill stopped earning its place in my
daily workflow, it was rewritten or removed.

Built by [Adrian Luna Díaz](https://alunadev.vercel.app) — AI-first Senior
Product Manager and Product Builder.

## Install

This is a skills library, not a plugin — plain markdown files any agent can
read. Two ways to wire it in:

### Symlink into your agent's global skills folder (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alunadev/ald-skills.git

# Claude Code
for d in ald-skills/skills/*/ ald-skills/workflows/*/; do
  ln -s "$(pwd)/$d" ~/.claude/skills/"$(basename "$d")"
done

# Any other agent that reads a shared skills folder (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, ...)
for d in ald-skills/skills/*/ ald-skills/workflows/*/; do
  ln -s "$(pwd)/$d" ~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$d")"
done
```

Skills become auto-discoverable in every session, on every project, with no
extra registration step. Pull the repo to update; the symlinks pick it up
immediately.

### Alternative: Claude Code Plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add alunadev/ald-skills
claude plugin install ald-skills@ald-skills
```

Convenient for a one-line install, but plugin-scoped discovery has been
unreliable outside the plugin's own working directory in testing — the
symlink method above is what this repo's author actually runs.

### Alternative: Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/alunadev/ald-skills.git ald-skills
git submodule update --init
```

## Why this exists

AI coding agents are only as good as the context and process you give them.
Instead of re-explaining how I write PRDs, structure discovery, design
interfaces, or ship features in every session, each practice lives in a
skill: a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that Claude loads on demand.

The result is a system where product work compounds — every session starts
with the accumulated judgment of all previous ones.

## Skill Format

Every skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md          ← Required: YAML frontmatter + skill body
└── references/       ← Optional: large rule sets loaded on demand
```

YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name                   # lowercase, hyphens
description: Third person. What it does and when to trigger it. Max 1024 chars.
---
```

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how a skill gets registered, symlinked, and committed.

## Full Skill Index

See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for the complete index with trigger
conditions and the PM → Engineering → Release workflow integration.

## The System Behind This

ald-skills is one layer of a larger operating system for AI-first product
work. The other layers (private): per-product context folders, an evidence
and profile pipeline, session logs with automatic rollup between repos, and
hooks that enforce the operating rules. The concept: **product work should
compound, not restart every session.**

If you're building something similar, the skill format plus the
`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the best place to start.
